# 👋 Hi, I'm Kingsley Eloebhose

**Data Analyst → Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer**  
📍 Lagos, Nigeria

I’m building a strong foundation in **Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence**, with hands-on experience in data analysis, regression modeling, and workflow automation.

My background in data analysis and automation helps me work confidently with real-world datasets — from data collection and preparation to model training and evaluation.

My long-term goal is to specialize in **Machine Learning & AI** and pursue a Master’s degree in Information Technology with a focus on intelligent systems.
